# Batch Image Inverter

## Description
The Batch Image Inverter is a Java application developed by Vaishali Vyas as an honors project for the ["Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) course on Coursera by Duke University. This application creates photographic negatives of images by inverting their colors and saves the altered images with new filenames in a specified directory, while preserving the original images.

## Features
* <b>Color Inversion</b>: Converts images to their color-inverted equivalents (photographic negatives).
* <b>Batch Processing</b>: Allows processing of multiple images in one go.
* <b>Custom Save Directory</b>: Saves the inverted images in a specified directory, separate from the originals.
* <b>Preservation of Originals</b>: Original images are not modified or overwritten.

## How to Use
1. <b>Setup</b>: Ensure you have Java installed and set up on your machine. Clone or download this repository.
2. <b>Run the Application</b>: Launch the application by running the main method in the BatchImageInverter class.
3. <b>Select Images</b>: Upon execution, choose the images you wish to invert. The application will process and save these images in the specified images directory.

## Requirements
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* The edu.duke package, as provided by the [DukeLearnToProgram](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/index.php) resources.
